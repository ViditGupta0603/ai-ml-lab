## Project Overview

This repo demonstrates a small but complete applied data-science workflow:

- Exploring and documenting tabular datasets  
- Checking correlations between attributes  
- Conceptualizing regression problems  
- Joining related datasets  
- Handling missing values and outliers  
- Implementing everything in reproducible Python scripts  

There are two experiments:

1. MGNREGA At-a-Glance (Dataset 1)
2. POLLUTION (Dataset 2)
